This version of TightVNC allows you to remote control a system without transferring screenshots of the remote machine's desktop.
This is very useful if you are using vnc simply for remote controlling keyboard and mouse of a system next to you. 

Changes to TigerVNC:
* Only transfer remote desktop image when pressing the refresh button in the top menu.
* Only send certain mouse events every 10th msec. This reduces network transfer and load on the remote machine.
